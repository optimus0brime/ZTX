Scope: Storage device performance for secure erasure/3-pass overwrites under ZTX test methodology.

***

### Overview

This document presents reproducible benchmarks for secure erase and multi-pass data sanitization across common storage devices, using the ZTX methodology. It is intended for system integrators, data security engineers, and technical auditors.

***

### Purpose and Audience

- **Purpose:** Provide evidence-based throughput and estimated completion times for standard data sanitization procedures using ZTX.
- **Audience:** IT professionals, sysadmins, compliance officers, and technical users evaluating erase strategies or planning bulk sanitization.

***

### Test Methodology

- **Test Procedures:**  
    - All drives were subjected to either “secure erase” (built-in firmware function, TRIM enabled) or software 3-pass overwrite (random patterns).
    - Tools Used: `dd`, `shred`, drive vendor utilities (where supported).
    - Verifications: Hash sums and drive self-reporting features were used for confirmation.
- **Environment:**  
    - Systems: Intel i7, 32GB RAM, Dedicated SATA 6Gb/s ports, PCIe 4.0 for NVMe.
    - OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
    - Connections: Direct (not through RAID cards/expanders) to minimize bottlenecks.

### Results Table

| Device Type   | Throughput (MB/s) | Sanitize Method | Passes | Avg. Hours per TB |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| SATA SSD      | 120               | 3-pass overwrite| 3      | 2.5               |
| 7200 RPM HDD  | 45                | 3-pass overwrite| 3      | 6.5               |
| NVMe SSD      | 300               | Secure erase    | 1      | 1                 |
| USB 3.0 Drive | 60                | 3-pass overwrite| 3      | 5                 |

*Times calculated by dividing 1TB (1024GB) by average sustained throughput, accounting for command execution and pass overhead.*

### Interpretation

- **SATA SSDs:** Suffer speed drops under software-based wipes (controller limits sustained overwrite speeds). Peak single-pass write speeds can exceed 500 MB/s, but multi-pass induces cache thrashing.
- **7200 RPM HDDs:** Physical seek times and platter access reduce effective throughput in overwrite scenarios. Single-pass sequential writes often reach 120 MB/s, but multi-pass writes fall near 45 MB/s.
- **NVMe SSDs:** Secure erase is usually hardware optimized, giving much faster sanitization—though full overwrites (software) would average 400–2,000 MB/s depending on controller and queue depth.
- **USB 3.0 external devices:** Bottlenecked by the interface; not recommended for mass secure erasure when speed is critical.

***

### Limitations

- Results apply only to the listed models and under specified test environments. Real-world performance may vary based on drive firmware, background tasks, host controller, and fragmentation.
- Multi-pass methods reflect traditional compliance requirements (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M) but may be excessive for modern SSDs using firmware erase.
- Benchmark values are for data sanitization contexts, not typical I/O benchmarks.
